# Heatlth Trends Visualization
In this project I create an interactive visualization for users to see trends between various health risk factors. The visualization produced would theoretically be presented on a newspaper's website.

## Directories and Files
`D3_data_journalism` contains all files to produce the visualization:
* `index.html` - the webpage that displays the visualization
* `assets` - contains the `css`, `data`, and `js` (javascript) files to produce the visualization on the webpage

## Steps to create this visualization:
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Open `index.html` with a live server
